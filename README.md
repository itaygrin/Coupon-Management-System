# Coupon-Management-System
This is a coupon management system created using Spring JPA framework. The system allows managing a coupon database including creating new coupons and buying coupons.
The project is a project I made while learning about SpringJPA framework and how to use it.
  The program devides 3 types of users:
    - Admin: who can add new companies to the Database and get access to everything.
    - Company: who can create new coupons that'll be sent to the DB. A company can fetch their coupons and also alter and update their coupons.
    - Customer: the user that purchases coupons. The customer is able to search by certain keys like ID of a coupon or max price etc..
